## Description Contents
There are multiple steps involved in setting up a fully fledged demo cluster. In case you have further ideas about features of MongoDB Atlas that are easy to demo, let me know!

The following steps need to be stepped through in order to set up the Demo Cluster fully:

1. [Create Atlas Cluster](#-create-atlas-cluster)
2. Generate Workload on Cluster
3. Performance Advisor Demo Setup 
4. Atlas Search Demo Setup
5. Charts Demo Setup
6. GraphQL Demo Setup


The [Atlas Demo Discovery Playbook Cheatsheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RZVWKsR6CjSKoByxyPiUxgaQ-opjNCSrYiRDCUwC23U/edit#heading=h.744mm6ty7947) provides a "manual" for a walk through the different Atlas Features and some relevant questions to ask.
